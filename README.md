## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the election audit analysis is to determine the winning candidate and the county with the largest turnout as well as providing specific data regarding each county and candidate based on the raw election data.

## Election-Audit Summary

To the election commission, the above script can be modified in order to analyze data for any given election. For example, the counties can be changed to states, and the candidates may be presidential candidates. We can then utilize a modified version of the script to capture election results for presidential elections instead of congressional elections. In a school election, where the candidate who receives the most popular vote becomes president and the candidate with the second most number of votes becomes vice president, this script can also be modified to address this need. We can modify the output to display both the winner and the runner-up and allocate the president and vice president title based on candidate vote counts accordingly.
